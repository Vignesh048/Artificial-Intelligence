## 1. Search Methods Artificial-Intelligence
#### The code has implementation of Breadth first search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A* Search.
#### The final code is about creating a own tree using the user input

## 2. K- means Clustering
#### Solving the given problem which involves implementation of K- means clustering Algorithm

a) User the random number generator numpy.random.randn to to create 5 clusters of size (100,2) each. The cluster
centers are [(0,0), (0,2), (1, 1),(2,0),(2,2)].
b) Visualize the data using scatter plot from matplotlib package.
2) Clustering using K-mean algorithm:
a) In real data, we do not know the number of clusters can be there. Hence, we will perform
b) Consider there are K number of means. Assign data points randomly to each cluster from your synthetic data. Compute
the mean of each cluster.
c) Find the distance of each datapoint from all the K clusters. Assign the datapoint with the label of its nearest mean center.
(Use euclidian distance computation method).
d) Repeat the steps a and b untill the stopping criteria met.
e) Stopping criteria: change in average of the K means is less than a threshold (e.g., 0.5. Appropriately change the
threshold by verifying whether yours clusters are converging or not).
f) Visualize your output for K = 2, 3,...,10.
